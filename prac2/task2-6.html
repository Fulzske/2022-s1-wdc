<div>
<h1>Check out my borders</h1>
<p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px<br>radius.</p>
<p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p><hr>
<p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.</p>
<p>Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
<div id="divRed">This div has a red border</div>
<div id="divBlue">This div has a blue border</div>
<p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
<div id="divRed8x">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
<div id="divBlue8x">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
