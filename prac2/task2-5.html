<div class="content">
<h1>A page some with some divs and spans</h1>
<p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
<p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p><hr>
<p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue </span><span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>because they belongs to two calsses called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
</div>
<div>This text is inside a normal div, but he background has not been set.</div>
